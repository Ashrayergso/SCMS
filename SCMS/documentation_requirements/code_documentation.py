"""
This module contains the guidelines for code documentation in the Ship Crew Management System (SCMS).

The purpose of code documentation is to make the code easier to understand, maintain, and scale. It should provide a clear understanding of what each part of the code does, how it does it, and why it does it that way.

Here are the guidelines for code documentation in SCMS:

1. Commenting: Every function, class, and module should have a descriptive comment explaining what it does. The comment should be concise and clear.

2. Docstrings: Python docstrings (i.e., comments in the triple quotes) should be used for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods. Docstrings become the __doc__ special attribute for that object.

3. Code Explanation: Besides the basic description, the comments should also explain the logic behind the code, especially if it involves complex operations.

4. Consistency: The documentation style should be consistent throughout the project. It's recommended to follow a recognized standard such as Google Python Style Guide or Sphinx.

5. Updates: The comments should be updated whenever the code is modified.

6. Avoid Obvious Comments: Avoid writing comments for obvious code. The code should be self-explanatory.

Remember, the main purpose of comments is to help other developers (and your future self) understand the code. It's not about explaining what the code is doing but why it is doing it.

# Example of a function with proper documentation
def assign_crew_members(crew_id, ship_id):
    """
    Assigns a crew member to a ship.

    This function takes a crew member's ID and a ship's ID as input, checks the availability of the crew member and the requirement of the ship, and assigns the crew member to the ship if both conditions are met.

    Args:
    crew_id (int): The ID of the crew member.
    ship_id (int): The ID of the ship.

    Returns:
    bool: True if the crew member is successfully assigned, False otherwise.
